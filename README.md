## FAQ

#### How is the database run/created/initialized?

The EHealth4U application has a database run solely on csv files due
to the limited ressources provided to us during the timeframe we were
alloted to work on the project.

#### How long did it take to complete this project?

This project took us about 2 months of planning and coding
in order to create a minimalistic yet efficient hospital application.
